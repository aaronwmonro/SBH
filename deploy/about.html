                        WHO WE ARE
                    </h2>
                    <p class="sub-paragraph">Brothers, Richard &amp; Chad Schwab have served in the forestry industry for over 30 years and
                        continue to do so today. Their ingrained understanding of managing a business that is subject to
                        production-based markets is beyond reproach.
                        The high costs to repair and conduct preventative maintenance on equipment in this industry and
                        industries alike became very apparent to them early on. This is what led to the development of
                        Schwab Brothers Hydraulics. The Brothers wanted to create an avenue for people to
                        receive fair service and pricing on heavy equipment repair and hydraulic components because
                        these factors enable businesses such as yours to continue to thrive. That is why at Schwab
                        Brothers Hydraulics our vision is to apply great service and fair pricing that is not consumed by
                        high profit margins as most businesses are but apply these things because it is for the benefit of
                        the people we serve. <br>
                        <br>
                        We would like to schedule a meeting to get to know you and your business and discuss what we
                        can offer while annotating your needs and requirements. We will generate comparisons to show
                        you the hard evidence of how much you will save and how much more profit you will create by
                        doing your business with Schwab Brothers Hydraulics all without sacrificing product quality.</p>

                                <p class="sub-paragraph">Our hose and fitting product line has been put to the test by ourselves in the logging woods and
                                    third party testing applications. It has outperformed all competitors to include Parker, SEL, and
                                    Semperit. Our product is a non-Asian manufactured product. This increases quality but also
                                    excludes current tariffs driving down the cost of our product. We have all the certified
                                    documents showing the results of all tests completed to back up this claim.</p>
