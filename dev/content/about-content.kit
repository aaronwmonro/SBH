                WHO WE ARE
            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph">Brothers, Richard &amp; Chad Schwab have served in the forestry industry for over 30 years and
                continue to do so today. Their ingrained understanding of managing a business that is subject to
                production-based markets is beyond reproach.
                The high costs to repair and conduct preventative maintenance on equipment in this industry and
                industries alike became very apparent to them early on. This is what led to the development of
                Schwab Brothers Hydraulics. The Brothers wanted to create an avenue for people to
                receive fair service and pricing on heavy equipment repair and hydraulic components because
                these factors enable businesses such as yours to continue to thrive. That is why at Schwab
                Brothers Hydraulics our vision is to apply great service and fair pricing that is not consumed by
                high profit margins as most businesses are but apply these things because it is for the benefit of
                the people we serve. <br>
                <br>
                We would like to schedule a meeting to get to know you and your business and discuss what we
                can offer while annotating your needs and requirements. We will generate comparisons to show
                you the hard evidence of how much you will save and how much more profit you will create by
                doing your business with Schwab Brothers Hydraulics all without sacrificing product quality.</p>

                            Semperit. Our product is a non-Asian manufactured product. This increases quality but also
                            excludes current tariffs driving down the cost of our product. We have all the certified
                            documents showing the results of all tests completed to back up this claim.</p>
